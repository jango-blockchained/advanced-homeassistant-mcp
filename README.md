# Model Context Protocol Server for Home Assistant

The server uses the MCP protocol to share access to a local Home Assistant instance with an LLM application.

A powerful bridge between your Home Assistant instance and Language Learning Models (LLMs), enabling natural language control and monitoring of your smart home devices through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This server provides a comprehensive API for managing your entire Home Assistant ecosystem, from device control to system administration.

## Features

- üéÆ **Device Control**: Control any Home Assistant device through natural language
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates**: Get instant updates through Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- ü§ñ **Automation Management**: Create, update, and manage automations
- üìä **State Monitoring**: Track and query device states
- üîê **Secure**: Token-based authentication and rate limiting
- üì± **Mobile Ready**: Works with any HTTP-capable client

## Real-time Updates with SSE

The server includes a powerful Server-Sent Events (SSE) system that provides real-time updates from your Home Assistant instance. This allows you to:

- üîÑ Get instant state changes for any device
- üì° Monitor automation triggers and executions
- üéØ Subscribe to specific domains or entities
- üìä Track service calls and script executions

### Quick SSE Example

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource(
  'http://localhost:3000/subscribe_events?token=YOUR_TOKEN&domain=light'
);

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Update received:', data);
};
```

See [SSE_API.md](docs/SSE_API.md) for complete documentation of the SSE system.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jango-blockchained/homeassistant-mcp.git
cd homeassistant-mcp

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the project
bun run build
```

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

The project includes Docker support with Bun for optimal performance and consistent environments across different platforms.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jango-blockchained/homeassistant-mcp.git
    cd homeassistant-mcp
    ```

2. **Configure environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file with your Home Assistant configuration:
    ```env
    # Home Assistant Configuration
    HASS_HOST=http://homeassistant.local:8123
    HASS_TOKEN=your_home_assistant_token

- Maintenance Tasks

```bash
# Run standard analysis
bun run test:openai
# Select option 1 when prompted
```

### 2. Custom Prompt Analysis

Allows you to ask specific questions about your Home Assistant setup. The analysis can include:
- Device States
- Configuration Details
- Active Devices
- Device Attributes (brightness, temperature, etc.)

```bash
# Run custom analysis
bun run test:openai
# Select option 2 when prompted
```

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI integration, you need to set up your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
