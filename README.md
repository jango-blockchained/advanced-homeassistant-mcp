       }
   }
   ```

## How to Use

The server provides two main tools for interacting with Home Assistant:

### 1. List Devices Tool

Use this tool to discover all available devices and their current states:

```json
{
  "tool": "list_devices"
}
```

This will return a structured response with all devices grouped by domain:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "devices": {
    "light": [
      {
        "entity_id": "light.living_room",
        "state": "on",
        "attributes": {
          "brightness": 128,
          "color_temp": 4000,
          "friendly_name": "Living Room Light"
        }
      }
    ],
    "climate": [
      {
        "entity_id": "climate.bedroom",
        "state": "heat",
        "attributes": {
          "temperature": 22,
          "hvac_mode": "heat",
          "friendly_name": "Bedroom Thermostat"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Control Tool

Use this tool to control your devices. Here are some common usage examples:

#### Light Control

```json
// Turn on a light
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "turn_on",
  "entity_id": "light.living_room"
}

// Set brightness
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "turn_on",
  "entity_id": "light.living_room",
  "brightness": 128
}

// Set color temperature
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "turn_on",
  "entity_id": "light.living_room",
  "color_temp": 4000
}

// Set RGB color (red)
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "turn_on",
  "entity_id": "light.living_room",
  "rgb_color": [255, 0, 0]
}
```

#### Climate Control

```json
// Set temperature
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "set_temperature",
  "entity_id": "climate.living_room",
  "temperature": 22
}

  "tool": "control",
  "command": "set_hvac_mode",
  "entity_id": "climate.living_room",
  "hvac_mode": "heat"
}

// Set fan mode
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "set_fan_mode",
  "entity_id": "climate.living_room",
  "fan_mode": "auto"
}
```

#### Cover Control

```json
// Open/Close cover
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "open_cover",  // or "close_cover"
  "entity_id": "cover.living_room"
}

// Set position
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "set_position",
  "entity_id": "cover.living_room",
  "position": 50
}

// Set tilt
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "set_tilt_position",
  "entity_id": "cover.living_room",
  "tilt_position": 45
}
```

#### Switch Control

```json
// Turn on/off

  "entity_id": "switch.office"
}

// Toggle
{
  "tool": "control",
  "command": "toggle",
  "entity_id": "switch.office"
}
```

### Error Handling

The server provides clear error messages when something goes wrong:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Failed to execute set_temperature for light.living_room: Unsupported operation for domain: light"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
1. Invalid entity ID
2. Unsupported operation for domain
3. Invalid parameter values
4. Home Assistant connection issues

### Best Practices

1. **Entity Discovery**
   - Always use `list_devices` first to discover available entities
   - Note the supported attributes for each device

2. **Parameter Validation**
   - Brightness: 0-255
   - Position/Tilt: 0-100
   - Temperature: Depends on your system's configuration
   - Color temperature: Typically 2000-6500K

3. **Error Recovery**
   - If a command fails, check:
     - Entity ID exists and is correct
     - Command is supported by the domain
     - Parameters are within valid ranges

4. **State Awareness**
   - Use `list_devices` to check current state before making changes
   - Verify command execution by checking state afterward

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
yarn dev

# Build and start
yarn build:start

# Run tests
yarn test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify your Home Assistant instance is running
   - Check the HASS_HOST is correct and accessible
   - Ensure your token has the required permissions

2. **Entity Control Issues**
   - Verify the entity_id exists in Home Assistant
   - Check the entity domain matches the command
   - Ensure parameter values are within valid ranges

3. **Permission Issues**

## Using with LLMs (AI Assistants)

The MCP server is designed to work seamlessly with AI language models. Here's how to interact with your Home Assistant using natural language:

### Natural Language Examples

1. **Discovering Devices**
   ```
   "What devices do I have in my home?"
   "Show me all my lights"
   "List the climate controls in the bedroom"
   ```
   The LLM will use the `list_devices` tool to fetch and present this information in a human-readable format.

2. **Basic Controls**
   ```
   "Turn on the living room lights"
   "Set the bedroom temperature to 22 degrees"
   "Close all the blinds"
   ```
   The LLM will translate these commands into appropriate tool calls using the `control` tool.

3. **Complex Operations**
   ```
   "Make the living room cozy for movie night"
   ‚Üí LLM might:
   - Dim the lights (set brightness to 30%)
   - Set warm color temperature
   - Lower the blinds
   - Adjust the temperature

   "Set up my morning routine"
   ‚Üí LLM might:
   - Open the bedroom blinds
   - Turn on specific lights
   - Adjust the thermostat
   ```

4. **State-Aware Commands**
   ```
   "Is my front door closed?"
   "Which lights are currently on?"
   "What's the temperature in the bedroom?"
   ```
   The LLM will check current states using `list_devices` before responding.

### Context and Memory

The LLM can maintain context across multiple interactions:

```
User: "How warm is it in the bedroom?"
LLM: [checks temperature] "The bedroom is currently 20¬∞C"
User: "Make it a bit warmer"
LLM: [remembers context, adjusts by reasonable increment] "I'll increase it to 22¬∞C"
```

### Natural Parameter Handling

The LLM can interpret natural language into specific parameters:

```
"Make the lights very dim" ‚Üí brightness: 10%
"Set a comfortable temperature" ‚Üí temperature: 21-23¬∞C
"Change the lights to a warm color" ‚Üí color_temp: ~2700K
```

### Intelligent Error Prevention

The LLM will:
1. Validate commands before execution
2. Check device capabilities
3. Ensure parameters are within acceptable ranges
4. Provide helpful feedback if a command can't be executed

Example:
```
User: "Set the kitchen light to blue"
LLM: [checks if the light supports RGB]
- If supported: Sets rgb_color to [0, 0, 255]
- If not supported: "I'm sorry, but your kitchen light doesn't support color changes. I can only adjust its brightness."
```

### Best Practices for LLM Interactions

1. **Be Specific with Locations**
   - Good: "Turn on the kitchen lights"
   - Better: "Turn on the lights above the kitchen counter"

2. **Use Natural Increments**
   - "Make it a little brighter" ‚Üí +20% brightness
   - "Make it much warmer" ‚Üí +3-4¬∞C

3. **Group Related Commands**
   ```
   "Set up the living room for watching TV:
   - Dim the lights to 20%
   - Set them to a warm color
   - Lower the blinds
   - Set the temperature to 22 degrees"
   ```

4. **Ask for Confirmation**
   ```
   User: "Turn off all lights"
   LLM: "I'll turn off all 12 lights in your home. Would you like me to proceed?"
   ```

### Handling Complex Scenarios

1. **Conditional Commands**
   ```
   "If the temperature is above 25¬∞C, turn on the fan"
   ‚Üí LLM will:
   1. Check current temperature
   2. Execute command if condition is met
   ```

2. **Time-Based Context**
   ```
   "Set up my evening lighting"
   ‚Üí LLM considers:
   - Time of day
   - Current light levels
   - User preferences
   ```

3. **Multi-Room Coordination**
   ```
   "Prepare the house for bedtime"
   ‚Üí LLM orchestrates:
   - Turning off main living area lights
   - Dimming hallway lights
   - Setting night mode temperatures
   - Ensuring doors are locked
   ```

### Troubleshooting with LLMs

The LLM can help diagnose issues:
```
User: "The living room lights aren't responding"
LLM: Let me check:
1. Verifies device availability
2. Checks current state
3. Reviews recent commands
4. Suggests potential solutions
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Confirmation for Critical Actions**
   - The LLM will ask for confirmation before:
     - Controlling security devices
     - Making large temperature changes
     - Executing commands affecting multiple devices

2. **Permission Awareness**
   - The LLM respects device permissions
   - Provides clear feedback when actions aren't permitted
